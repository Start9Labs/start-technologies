# AGENTS.md

This is a StartOS service-package repository — it builds a `.s9pk` for StartOS.

Develop it inside a StartOS packaging workspace created by `start-cli s9pk init-workspace`,
which provides the packaging guide and agent context one level up. If you're reading this in a
bare clone with no workspace, the full guide is at <https://docs.start9.com/packaging>.

**Start every task at the recipe index** — `../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/recipes.md`
(or <https://docs.start9.com/packaging/recipes.html>). It maps an intent ("prompt the user to create
admin credentials", "expose a web UI") to the constructs, the reference pages, and a named production
package to copy. Find the recipe before you read this package's neighbours: a package you reach by
grepping may be non-conformant, and the recipe outranks it.

Work this package's `TODO.md` from top to bottom. Keep `README.md` (the package's technical reference — the only one an AI support or administering agent reads) and `instructions.md` (end-user docs) in sync with your changes.

## This repo

<!--
TODO: write the bullets for this package, then delete this comment.

Only what someone *changing* this package needs and cannot get from README.md or
instructions.md. What belongs here, and what does not, is set out under
"AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md":

  ../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/project-structure.md

A simple package needs none of this — delete the section rather than padding it.
